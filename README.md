# European-Soccer-Database

This was a project I had as a part of The Data Analyst Nanodegree on Udacity. I will be working on it to expand it and to practice `SQL`, `pandas` and `seaborn`.

The database is too big to uplaod. I will figure another way to load it in the notebook. For now, you can download it from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/hugomathien/soccer).
