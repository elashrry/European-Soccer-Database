# European-Soccer-Database

This was a project I had as a part of The Data Analyst Nanodegree on Udacity. I will be working on it to expand it and to practice `SQL`, `pandas` and `seaborn`.

The database is too big to uplaod, and I had some problems installing `kaggle` module to download it to the notebook directly. I will figure another way later. For now, you can download it from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/hugomathien/soccer).
